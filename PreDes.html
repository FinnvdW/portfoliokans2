    <div id="tekst1"><font color="white"><center>Predictive Design made us use AI based calculations through data based on surveys, with which we could make an app. Our app was made for couples to test how well their relationship was going. Based on the score, it would recommend certain activities or other things to strengthen your bond. The app, however, had an evil version as well, which would ask a lot of permissions (like location), have a very long TOS, and would recommend activities and other things that specifically costed money. Within this module I learned how to use data to create a predicting AI system.</center></font></div>
